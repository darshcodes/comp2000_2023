Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?
  both websites are good hosts for version control which allow you to work on projects together and collaboratively which teach stuff like
  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
  Mathew roberts
  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
  Jon Mountjoy
  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
  Dave pearce for both
  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? 🤔 If not, what do you think happened?
  No, the project could have been completed or they started working on a new release of the product or software.
  * 🤔 Which file in each project has had the most activity?
  


# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
